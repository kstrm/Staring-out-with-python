# Getting going with Python and Jupyter notebooks

## The examples

Above are a few Jupyter notebooks with examples that highlight basic commands in numpy, scipy, and matplotlob for simple procedures such as:
* indexing, arrays, and loops
* ways to approximate a derivative
* solving functions
* plotting

You can view the files simply by clicking on the file link in the directory above. To run the notebooks, you will either need to use a cloud-based computing service (such as SageMathCloud, see below), or you will need to install a python distribution on your computer (below you will find information on how to install on your local machine). In you are going to be using python, then I strongly suggest you install it on your local machine.

Note, to view the interactive plots in the example "03 Derivatives.ipynb", you will need to view it through the [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) at Jupyter.org. You can do so by [clicking here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kstrm/Starting-out-with-python/blob/master/Derivatives.ipynb), or by clicking on the file of interest, copying the url from your browser, and then pasting it into the [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

## Running python

**In the cloud**
- [SageMathCloud](https://sagemathcloud.com) is a fantastic free resource for collaborative coding in python and many other languages. Using python and/or jupyter notebooks on SageMathCloud is a perfect place to start.

**On your local computer**
* Continuum Analytics “Anaconda” distribution: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
* To use, you can run/execute python commands with the terminal, an [ipython terminal](http://ipython.org/), the [Spyper IDE](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/) (a matlab like environment), or my favorite (for short computations and data analysis) - [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
