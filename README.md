**Running and using python and Jupyter notebooks in the cloud**
- [SageMathCloud](https://sagemathcloud.com) is a fantastic free resource for collaborative coding in python and many other languages. Using python and/or jupyter notebooks on SageMathCloud is a fantastic place to start.

Getting and running python on your local computer
* Continuum Analytics “Anaconda” distribution: https://www.continuum.io/downloads 
* To use, you can run/execute python commands with the terminal, an ipython terminal, the Spyper IDE (matlab like environment), or my favorite (for short computations and data analysis) - Jupyter notebooks.

Plotting
* Basic… start here: Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org)
* Interactive plotting: Bokeh (http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)
* Using Pandas dataframes: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html

Tutorials
* Jupyter Notebook Tutorial: The Definitive Guide
* Pandas Tutorial: DataFrames in Python
* Basic features of SageMathCloud (note.. the video is long ≈ 1 hr)

Notes

The attached zipped folder has two Jupyter notebook examples highlighting basic commands in numpy. Both .ipynb and .html version the following are included,
* indexing, arrays, and loops
* ways to approximate a derivative
